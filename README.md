# 🌾 Small Grain Classification and Grading

This project presents a comprehensive deep learning-based solution for **classification** and **grading** of small grains using computer vision techniques. Unlike most existing research which focuses on rice grain classification alone, our project pioneers a more generalizable model applicable to **a wide variety of small grains**, and uniquely addresses **grading** alongside classification.

## 🧠 Models Used

### 🔹 For **Classification**:
We experimented with the following models:

- **EfficientNetB0**
- **ResNet50**
- **MobileNetV3**
- **VGG16**
- **VGG19**
- **AlexNet**
- **Custom CNN**

#### 📊 Classification Accuracy Comparison

| Model          | Accuracy (%) |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| EfficientNetB0 | **99.22**    |
| ResNet50       | 99.08        |
| MobileNetV3    | 99.17        |
| VGG16          | 97.29        |
| VGG19          | 94.97        |
| AlexNet        | 92.44        |
| Custom CNN     | 90.74        |

### 🔸 For **Grading**:
- **EfficientNetB2**
- **ResNet50**

Our grading models are trained on a **custom-created dataset**, designed and annotated manually.  
> 📌 *Due to project policies, we have chosen not to disclose the grading dataset.*
